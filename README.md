## General info
I created the project to imporve my skills in building websites from scratch. I used all the techniques I learned over the course of several weeks of coding i.e
* layouts with flexbox,
* CSS transitions,
* basics of Bootstrap,
* responsive design 
.. and many more

The fictional company I create a website for has a personal undertone. Husti is my nickname and I am a graduated architect. I tried to create an easy on the eyes website that I wish my own company had.
